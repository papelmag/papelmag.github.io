<div align="center"><b>THE NATIONAL PRAYER BREAKFAST AND ITS OFFSHOOTS</b></div>
<div align="center">&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Worldly Power: Family Style&rdquo; has been presented in two parts. Part One appeared in the Big Bang Issue of Papel Mag (October 27, 2009). It concerns the Family&rsquo;s behind-the-scenes global prayer group movement that was founded by Abraham (a/k/a Abram) Vereide, a Norwegian immigrant preacher, in Seattle,  Washington in 1935. At the age of 49 Vereide formulated <i>the Idea</i>,<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span><span><span><span>[1]</span></span></span></span></a> his realization that he should stop ministering to the needy and, thereafter, dedicate himself to the spiritual affairs of the wealthy. Ten years later Vereide dubbed his vision &lsquo;the new world order.&rsquo; By then, he had moved his headquarters to Washington, D.C. where he ingratiated himself with the wealthy and the powerful, and pushed his prayer group movement worldwide<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span><span><span>[2]</span></span></span></a> including Puerto Rico.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span><span><span>[3]
</span></span></span></a>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div align="center"><b>A. THE NATIONAL PRAYER BREAKFAST</b></div>
<div align="center">&nbsp;<img hspace="5" width="50%" vspace="5" border="0" align="left" src="/images/stories/queeritics/william_tells/worldy_power_2/National_Prayer_Breakfast.jpg" alt="President Barack Obama at the National Prayer Breakfast" /></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1953 Vereide maneuvered President Dwight D. Eisenhower (a/k/a Ike) into attending the first annual National Prayer Breakfast. Since then, no president including President Barack Obama<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span><span><span>[4]</span></span></span></a> has dared to dismiss it. In Part Two of &ldquo;Worldly Power: Family Style&rdquo; the outwardly innocuous, but inwardly sordid history of the Family&rsquo;s National Prayer Breakfast and its offshoots will be scrutinized.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How did Vereide and Senator Frank Carlson (R-KS), one of his closest allies in Washington D.C., connive in 1951 to replace the Republican front-runner for president, Ohio Senator Robert Taft, the author of the reprehensible Taft-Hartley Act,<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span><span><span>[5]</span></span></span></a> with Carlson&rsquo;s friend and fellow Kansan<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span><span><span>[6]</span></span></span></a> Ike Eisenhower,<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span><span><span>[7]</span></span></span></a> a five-star general in the Army, who had become the most popular person in the United States of America after WWII?</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They contacted Ed Cabaniss, a wealthy manufacturer, who then was president of the ICL.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span><span><span>[8]</span></span></span></a> They asked him to create prayer cells in every state to beat the drum for Eisenhower&rsquo;s candidacy.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span><span><span>[9]</span></span></span></a> Carlson surreptitiously convinced delegates to the GOP convention that a popular general like Ike would unite the citizenry that was wary of war and fearful of communism more easily than a &ldquo;professional&rdquo; politician<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span><span><span>[10]</span></span></span></a> like Taft and promised appointments in exchange for their support. Taft and Carlson reached a <i>quid pro quo</i> agreement&mdash;the former would relinquish his presidential ambition in exchange for the position of Senate majority leader and the latter&rsquo;s promise to espouse the reversal of the New Deal.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span><span><span>[11]</span></span></span></a> Taft believed Eisenhower shared his &ldquo;distaste for organized labor, indifference to civil rights, and a firm conviction that capitalism constituted a natural law more certain than the physics of nuclear fission&rdquo; so he agreed.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span><span><span>[12]</span></span></span></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carlson enlisted Reverend Billy Graham, a registered Democrat at the time, for the Eisenhower campaign. During the campaign, when Graham discovered Eisenhower had no church affiliation, he convinced him that this would create brouhaha among his (Graham&rsquo;s) followers and the public in general unless he joined one. Graham deemed the United States to be a Christian nation and believed it was time for the New Testament to trump the Constitution. Vereide&rsquo;s frustrated earlier attempts to persuade a president to attend one of his prayer breakfasts would finally come to fruition with Graham&rsquo;s assistance. Graham too had &ldquo;been talking about a Presidential Prayer Breakfast&rdquo;. Eisenhower rebuked Carlson&rsquo;s invitation alleging that he &ldquo;did not want to set a precedent&rdquo;; but when Graham intervened, Eisenhower could not refuse to make an appearance. Graham brought his evangelical followers out in droves to elect Eisenhower; therefore, he attended the first Presidential Prayer Breakfast to pay his political debts. Eisenhower insisted that there be no radio or television coverage to avoid public scrutiny, which suited the secretive Vereide. Unlike Graham, Vereide was only interested in the wealthy and powerful; not in finding favor with the masses. Graham gave the blessing before a crowd of approximately 400 at the Conrad Hilton in Washington. &ldquo;Eisenhower was the first twentieth-century Republican to come to power in part through an alliance of populist evangelicals (led by Graham) and of elite fundamentalism [Vereide&rsquo;s Family].&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span><span><span>[13]</span></span></span></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eisenhower was assailable when it came to religious issues. His parents repudiated Mennonitism<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span><span><span>[14]</span></span></span></a> (a/k/a Anabaptism) and became Jehovah Witnesses<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span><span><span>[15]</span></span></span></a> when he was five years old. Eisenhower was a Jehovah Witness until 1911 when he was admitted to West Point,<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span><span><span>[16]</span></span></span></a> which brought disharmony to the family. Many Eisenhower biographies fail to fully and honestly disclose his parents' religious affiliation. Even Graham, who became Eisenhower's spiritual mentor and close friend, was told his parents had always been Mennonites. <b>&nbsp;</b>The Eisenhowers and the overwhelmingly unctuous press concealed this dishonesty to champion Ike. Nobody in Ike&rsquo;s fiercely protective camp wanted his Jehovah Witness background exposed because the Witnesses are opposed to the flag salute, all patriotic activities and blood transfusions&mdash;all of which are anathema to most U.S. citizens. During the presidential campaign mainstream religious zealots and political foes had harangued that a Jehovah Witness was not fit to become president.<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span><span><span>[17]</span></span></span></a> These opponents regarded Eisenhower to be a hypocrite because he never went to or joined a church<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span><span><span>[18]</span></span></span></a> after he abandoned the Truth<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span><span><span>[19]</span></span></span></a> and entered the Army until after he was elected President.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It appears that Ike&rsquo;s detractors might have been onto something? Jehovah Witnesses reckon all other churches (both Christian and non-Christian) are false; therefore, they profess that all priests and ministers are Satan&rsquo;s allies. Witnesses believe there is no eternal hell for the wicked. Therefore, non-believers including apostates [the wicked] will cease to exist and be doomed to spend eternity in a state of nothingness instead of either (1) rising from the dead and spending eternity in heaven as spirit creatures with Jehovah God, the alleged &ldquo;Anointed Class&rdquo; or &ldquo;Little Flock&rdquo;, which is restricted to 144,000 Witnesses that was exhausted in 1935 [albeit a dwindling 8,700 of those chosen were supposedly still living then], or (2) remaining in &ldquo;Paradise&rdquo; on earth under Jesus Christ&rsquo;s rule&mdash;Witnesses consider Him to be &ldquo;a god&rdquo; [John 1:1] who is lesser than the Almighty or Jehovah God&mdash;as part of the so-called &ldquo;Great Crowd&rdquo; or &ldquo;Other Sheep&rdquo;, &nbsp;all remaining Witnesses who were not anointed one of Jehovah God&rsquo;s chosen children, but happen to be in &ldquo;good standing&rdquo; at&nbsp;death.<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span><span><span>[20]</span></span></span></a> It is mere speculation: Did Ike, a disfellowshipped apostate with no hope of salvation, originally envisage, upon the termination of his military service and presidency, to request that the Elders, three male congregational leaders who serve both as judges and jury, reinstate him into the Watchtower Organization?</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vereide, Graham and Carlson, three canny operators, intimidated Eisenhower into attending the first Presidential Prayer Breakfast<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span><span><span>[21]</span></span></span></a> on February 5, 1953. How? Eisenhower had religious vulnerabilities&mdash;his JW upbringing, no religious affiliation and church nonattendance. Thereafter, he would, even more fervently, endeavor to redress these vulnerabilities<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span><span><span>[22]</span></span></span></a> by appeasing members of the Family while simultaneously defying secular citizens who wanted to conserve the constitutionally protected doctrine of separation of church and state, as well as Jehovah Witnesses who considered him to be an apostate.</div>
<div>For example, Senator Homer Ferguson (R-MI), an ILC (<b>supra</b> footnote 7) board member, sponsored an initiative, which was financed by businessman, philanthropist and self-help author W. Clement Stone,<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span><span><span>[23]</span></span></span></a> to amend the Pledge of Allegiance.<a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span><span><span>[24]</span></span></span></a> Mr. Stone founded the Religious Heritage of America (RHA) Foundation, a national interfaith organization that was instrumental in getting the phrase &ldquo;Under God&rdquo; inserted in the Pledge of Allegiance.<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><sup><sup><span>[25]</span></sup></sup></a> &ldquo;One driving force [behind this amendment] was the Catholic fraternal society the Knights of Columbus.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span><span><span>[26]</span></span></span></a>&nbsp;Notwithstanding, the &quot;under God&quot; movement did not prosper until February of 1954 when Reverend George M. Docherty, Eisenhower&rsquo;s Presbyterian<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span><span><span>[27]</span></span></span></a> pastor adroitly sermonized, with the president in attendance, about the imperative need to insert &ldquo;under God&rdquo; in the Pledge of Allegiance.<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span><span><span>[28]</span></span></span></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This dedicatory prayer breakfast, a parachurch event, seemed to nearly overwhelm Eisenhower, a customarily sedate and outwardly secular president. His opening remarks were: &nbsp;&ldquo;Mr. Chairman [Senator Carlson], distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen: This has been a wholly enjoyable occasion for me except for the one second when I opened the little blue slip and found that it said there would be an address by the President. I assure you, both for your sakes and for mine, there will not be. There are a few thoughts, though, that crowd into my mind. With your permission I will attempt to utter them in a very informal and homely way.&rdquo; Eisenhower concluded: &ldquo;Until I started over I had the picture, which Frank Carlson gave me last summer, of a small Congressional group of Congressmen and Senators who met on a morning each week. I had an idea of coming over to see 20 or 25 or maybe 50 people. I had no idea that our host had such a party as this. I do hope I may speak for all of you in thanking him for such a breakfast, the like of which I have not had in 10 years. As long as you feed me grits and sausage, everything will be all right. Thank you.&rdquo; <a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span><span><span>[29]</span></span></span></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many who are politically savvy justifiably oppose any president of the United States attending the Family&rsquo;s National Prayer Breakfast, a virtual back door for face time with the incumbent.<a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span><span><span>[30]</span></span></span></a>&nbsp;Probably even more people would feel dubious about presidents attending it if they were aware that usual State Department and administration vetting that is customarily required before the president meets foreign dignitaries have been circumvented at this sectarian event. The members of the Family, a network of elite Christian fundamentalists, are found in government, business and the military and are all about stealth, wealth, power, prestige and empire (<b>supra </b>notes 8 and 9).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the following excerpt from <i>The Family, </i>Jeff Sharlet warns: &ldquo;The Family has grown and taken root directly at the center of American democracy, intertwining with the world as it is. &lsquo;Business as usual&rsquo; is the Family&rsquo;s business. The elite fundamentalism of the Family doesn&rsquo;t lead us back to Plymouth Rock,<a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span><span>[</span></span></a><a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span><span><span>[31]</span></span></span></a><a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span><span>]</span></span></a> much less to the Taliban&rsquo;s Kabul. The Family&rsquo;s faith is not that of a walled-off community but of an empire; not one to&nbsp;come but one that already stretches around the globe, the soft empire of American dollars and, more subtly, American gods. If we want to understand this fundamentalism, we must ask not what it wants to do but what it has done: how it has run parallel to and at times flowed into the main currents of history.&rdquo; <a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><sup><span>[</span></sup></a><a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><sup><sup><span>[32]</span></sup></sup></a><a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><sup><span>]</span></sup></a></div>
<div>The National Prayer Breakfast, the Family&rsquo;s only ballyhooed encounter, has been broadcasted on C-Span<a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><sup><span>[</span></sup></a><a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><sup><sup><span>[33]</span></sup></sup></a><a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><sup><span>]</span></sup></a> in recent years.

For most, the breakfast is just that, muffins and prayer, but some stay on for days of seminars organized around Christ&rsquo;s message for particular industries. In years past, the Family organized such events for executives of oil, defense, insurance, and banking. The 2007 event drew, among others, a contingent of aid-hungry defense ministers from Eastern  Europe, Pakistan&rsquo;s famously corrupt Benazir Bhutto<a href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><span><span>[</span></span></a><a href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><span><span><span>[35]</span></span></span></a><a href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><span><span>]</span></span></a>, and a Sudanese general<a href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title=""><span><span><span><span>[36]</span></span></span></span></a> linked to Darfur.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title=""><span><span><span>[37]</span></span></span></a> <a href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48" title=""><span><span><span>[38]</span></span></span></a> <a href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49" title=""><span><span><span>[39]</span></span></span></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jeff Sharlet described the Family&rsquo;s influence peddling as follows: &ldquo;Dennis Bakke, former CEO of AES [Applied Energy Services], the largest independent power producer in the world,<a href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50" title=""><span><span>[</span></span></a><a href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" title=""><span><span><span>[40]</span></span></span></a><a href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52" title=""><span><span>]</span></span></a> and a Family insider,&hellip;the author of a popular business book titled <i>Joy at Work</i>, has long preached an ethic of social responsibility inspired by his evangelical faith and free-market convictions: &lsquo;I try to sell a way of life,&rsquo; he has said. &lsquo;I am a cultural imperialist.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s a phrase he uses to be provocative; he believes that Jesus is so universal that everyone wants Him. And, apparently, His business opportunities: Bakke was one of the pioneer thinkers of energy deregulation, the laissez-faire fever dream that culminated in the meltdown of<img hspace="5" height="186" width="150" vspace="5" border="0" align="right" src="/images/stories/queeritics/william_tells/worldy_power_2/douglas-coe.jpg" alt="Doug Coe: &quot;The Stealth Persuader&quot;" /> Enron.

AES announced that the Busoga had agreed to &lsquo;relocate&rsquo; the spirits of their dead. They weren&rsquo;t the only ones opposed; first environmentalists&hellip; and then even other foreign investors revolted against the project that seemed like it might actually increase the price of power for the poor. Bakke didn&rsquo;t worry. &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t go away,&rsquo; he&hellip;dispatched&hellip; the son of one of the Prayer Breakfast organizers, to be AES&rsquo;s in-country liaison&hellip; [who] was later accused of authorizing at least $400,000 in bribes.

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doug Coe, who currently oversees the Family, was dubbed &ldquo;The Stealth Persuader&rdquo; in the cover story of Time magazine&rsquo;s February 7, 2005 issue. <i>The 25 Most Influential Evangelicals in America</i> also reminded readers that: &ldquo;Many people think Congress is the host of the gala annual National Prayer Breakfast&hellip; It is not.

<div align="center"><b>B. THE OFFSHOOTS</b></div>
<div align="center">&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coe became a member of the Family in 1959. From the onset he launched an offensive to subjugate leaders in Africa, Asia and Latin America.<a href="#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61" title=""><sup><span>[</span></sup></a><a href="#_ftn62" name="_ftnref62" title=""><sup><sup><span>[45]</span></sup></sup></a><a href="#_ftn63" name="_ftnref63" title=""><sup><span>]</span></sup></a>&nbsp;These offshoots are analogous to franchises. &ldquo;Coe, Oregon born, cares most for the American Christ, His power spread throughout the world even as the homeland is denied Him in the secular folly of church/state separation. One day, Coe believes&mdash;not yet&mdash;America (and Old Europe, too&hellip;) will wake up and find itself surrounded by a hundred tiny God-led governments: Fiji, a &lsquo;model for the nations&rsquo; under theocratic regime after 2001, a family organizer boasted&hellip; and Uganda, made over as an experiment in faith-based initiatives by the Family&rsquo;s favorite African brother, the dictator Yoweri Museveni&hellip;&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn64" name="_ftnref64" title=""><span><span><span>[46]<img hspace="5" height="292" width="400" vspace="5" border="0" align="left" src="/images/stories/queeritics/william_tells/worldy_power_2/MuseveniX390.jpg" alt="Uganda President Yoweri Museveni" /></span></span></span></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Museveni is the equivalent to the Family&rsquo;s franchisee in Uganda. The Family resembles a franchisor. It invited Museveni to a National Prayer Breakfast and Museveni used this invitation to network and gain access to powerful people in Washington [name recognition]. In return, Museveni and his cohorts plug the Family&rsquo;s right-wing Jesus plus nothing theology [the product] thereby shaping Uganda&rsquo;s political and social agenda: The Family&rsquo;s Value Action<a href="#_ftn65" name="_ftnref65" title=""><span><span><span><span>[47]</span></span></span></span></a> wedge issues are green-<span>lighted</span> in Uganda while its members from home and in-country reap social, religious, political and economic benefits.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hitler&rsquo;s and Museveni&rsquo;s paths to consolidation of political and state power have been compared. They both deliberately and systematically engendered a climate of hate that framed genocide as both a necessary and unavoidable circumstance. Hitler headed a one-party state, and Museveni governs one too.<a href="#_ftn66" name="_ftnref66" title=""><span><span><span>[48]</span></span></span></a> &ldquo;Both leaders excoriated democracy, constitutionalism and the rule of law, preferring bellicose militarism&hellip; [They both] demonized their victims and proceeded to whip xenophobia and the fury of the population, initially as means to prosecute a war and eventually as a final solution in itself. For Hitler in Germany, the progressive conversion of Jews into enemies was later formalized by an executive decree in 1933, which pointed out that there was a Jewish problem. This graduated to the Nazi slogan that Jews were a misfortune.&nbsp;In Uganda, Museveni&rsquo;s coming to power was based on explaining national crises as caused by northerners, who came to be mostly identified with the Acholi population...;<sup> <a href="#_ftn67" name="_ftnref67" title=""><sup><span>[49]</span></sup></a></sup> and the derogatory NRM/A [National Resistance Movement/Army] slogan became Acholis are &ldquo;<i>Abanyanyas</i>&rdquo; [read as equivalent to the Nazis&rsquo; justification &ndash; <i>Jews were a misfortune</i>].&rdquo;&nbsp;<a href="#_ftn68" name="_ftnref68" title=""><span><span><span>[50]</span></span></span></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Family instructs its members to form a small <i>core group </i>or cell, &ldquo;a publicly invisible but privately identifiable group of companions.&rdquo; This cell has &ldquo;veto rights&rdquo; over each member&rsquo;s life. All members of the cell vow to eavesdrop on the others &ldquo;for deviations from Christ&rsquo;s will.&rdquo; <i>Thoughts on a core group</i> [a Family document] explicates: &ldquo;Communists use cells as their basic structure. The mafia operates like this, and the basic unit of the Marine Corps is the four man squad. Hitler, Lenin, and many others understood the power of a small core of people.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn69" name="_ftnref69" title=""><span><span>[</span></span></a><a href="#_ftn70" name="_ftnref70" title=""><span><span><span>[51]</span></span></span></a><a href="#_ftn71" name="_ftnref71" title=""><span><span>]</span></span></a>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The National Prayer Breakfast has been copied <i>ad nauseum </i>domestically<a href="#_ftn72" name="_ftnref72" title=""><span><span><span>[52]</span></span></span></a> <a href="#_ftn73" name="_ftnref73" title=""><span><span><span>[53]</span></span></span></a> and in foreign countries where Family members are in power and the prayer group movement is active. These foreign neocolonialist offshoots are more often than not sordid. Ugandan President Museveni, a member of the Family, who in 1997 attended the National Prayer Breakfast and has repeatedly visited the White House in Washington D.C. (<b>supra </b>note 41), hosts the Ugandan National Prayer Breakfast. This infamous offshoot exemplifies the Family&rsquo;s prayer group movement at its worst.</div>

<div align="center"><b>C.&nbsp;U.S. EVANGELICALS&rsquo; AND HATEMONGERS&rsquo; INVOLVMENT IN UGANDA&rsquo;S PROPOSED ANTI HOMOSEXUALITY BILL </b></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><img hspace="5" height="256" width="350" vspace="5" border="0" align="right" src="/images/stories/queeritics/william_tells/worldy_power_2/DavidBahati.jpg" alt="David Bahati: Proposer of The Anti-Homosexuality Bill in the Parliament of Uganda" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The remainder of Part Two of &ldquo;Worldly Power: Family Style&rdquo; will be dedicated to dissecting <i>The Anti Homosexuality Bill, 2009<a href="#_ftn74" name="_ftnref74" title=""><span><span><b><span>[54]</span></b></span></span></a></i>, a copy of which is attached hereto (<i>Memorandum </i>included) as <b>Appendix A</b>, that was introduced in the Parliament of Uganda by David Bahati, Member of Ndorwa County West Kabale, for the following objectives that were set forth in the accompanying <i>Memorandum</i>: To: &ldquo;(a) provide for marriage in Uganda as that contracted only between a man and a woman; (b) prohibit and penalize homosexual behavior and related practices in Uganda as they constitute a threat to the traditional family; [c] prohibit ratification of any international treaties, conventions, protocols, agreement and declarations which are contrary or inconsistent with the provisions of this Act; [and] (d) prohibit the licensing of organizations which promote homosexuality.&rdquo;</div>
<div>Objective (a) is straight out of the religious right&rsquo;s wedge issue playbook.<a href="#_ftn75" name="_ftnref75" title=""><span><span><span>[55]</span></span></span></a> Defining and &ldquo;defending&rdquo; marriage as an exclusive relationship between a man and a woman is supported by both elite and populist religious fundamentalists and their right-wing political allies.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Objective (b), the penalization of homosexual behavior, finally ended in the United States in 2003 when the Supreme Court, in a landmark opinion delivered by Justice Kennedy, <i>Lawrence v. Texas </i>(539 U. S. 558),<a href="#_ftn76" name="_ftnref76" title=""><span><span><span>[56]</span></span></span></a> resolved that &ldquo;a Texas statute making it a crime for two persons of the same sex to engage in certain intimate sexual conduct&hellip; furthers no legitimate state interest which can justify its intrusion into the personal and private life of the individual.&rdquo; The majority held that: &ldquo;The petitioners<a href="#_ftn77" name="_ftnref77" title=""><span><span><span>[57]</span></span></span></a> are entitled to respect for their private lives. The State cannot demean their existence or control their destiny by making their private sexual conduct a crime. Their right to liberty under the Due Process Clause gives them the full right to engage in their conduct without intervention of the government. It is a promise of the Constitution that there is a realm of personal liberty which the government may not enter.&rdquo;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even before homosexuality was decriminalized by virtue of this United States Supreme Court decision, the U.S. political and religious conservatives started promoting their homophobic politics in the Third World.<a href="#_ftn78" name="_ftnref78" title=""><span><span><span>[58]</span></span></span></a> For example, populist U.S. evangelical minister Rick &ldquo;Warren's bestselling book, A <i>Purpose Driven Life</i> is studied across sub-Saharan Africa and his Saddleback Church in Lake Forest, California has close ties with leaders across Africa, including, until recently, Martin Ssempa&hellip; [who] is one of the key architects of the antigay bill and persecution of LGBT people in Uganda. He made global news when he published the names of LGBT people in the local press and destroyed condoms to promote abstinence-only programs in the fight against HIV/AIDS in Uganda. Ssempa was a regular visitor to Saddleback until Warren distanced himself from him in 2008.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn79" name="_ftnref79" title=""><span><span><span>[59]</span></span></span></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Objective (c) is equivalent to self-defining Uganda as a pariah or rogue state<a href="#_ftn80" name="_ftnref80" title=""><span><span><span>[60]</span></span></span></a> that is intent on becoming a serial transgressor of human rights. &ldquo;For two days in early March 2009, Ugandans flocked to the Kampala Triangle Hotel for the Family Life Network's &lsquo;Seminar on Exposing the Homosexuals' Agenda.&rsquo; The seminar's very title revealed its claim: LGBT people and activists are engaged in a well thought-out plan to take over the world. The U.S. culture wars had come to Africa with a vengeance. To put on the conference, the Uganda-based Family Life Network&mdash;led by Stephen Langa with the goal of &lsquo;restoring&rsquo; traditional family values and morals in Uganda&mdash;teamed with two U.S. hatemongers from the Christian Right, Holocaust revisionist Scott Lively and Dan Schmierer of the ex-gay group Exodus International. Vocal opposition in international circles did not stop the country's high profile religious leaders, parliamentarians, police officers, teachers, and concerned parents from attending. Indeed, parliamentary action to wage war on gays was on the conference agenda. It was not enough that homosexuality is illegal in Uganda. As someone stated from the podium, [The parliament] &lsquo;feels it is necessary to draft a new law that deals comprehensively with the issue of homosexuality and &hellip;takes into account the international gay agenda&hellip;.Right now there is a proposal that a new law be drafted.&rsquo; The unsuspecting audience heard Lively promote his book, <i>The</i> <i>Pink Swastika,</i> and his argument that not only are gays seeking to take over the world, but they also threaten society by causing higher rates of divorce, child abuse, and HIV/AIDS. Legalizing homosexuality is on par with accepting &lsquo;molestation of children or having sex with animals,&rsquo; he said. As Lively puts it, LGBT issues cannot be considered human rights issues.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn81" name="_ftnref81" title=""><span><span><span>[61]</span></span></span></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Objective (d) makes it absolutely clear that <i>The</i> <i>Anti Homosexuality Bill </i>could not be implemented without condemning gay people in Uganda&mdash;it will make everyone spy on his or her neighbors, relatives and guests; interfere with and/or ban inclusive social and business enterprises; and generally intimidate and endanger tourists and Ugandan citizens alike regardless of their sexual orientation.<a href="#_ftn82" name="_ftnref82" title=""><span><span><span>[62]</span></span></span></a> Freedom of association, a cherished core human right, would no longer exist in<img hspace="5" height="304" width="337" vspace="5" border="0" align="left" src="/images/stories/queeritics/william_tells/worldy_power_2/cohenpeghole.jpg" alt="Richard A.

<div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Rachel Maddow aired Richard A. Cohen&rsquo;s ludicrous assertion that he was &ldquo;a victim of a hate crime&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn89" name="_ftnref89" title=""><span><span><span>[69]</span></span></span></a> informed people perceived what an implacable charlatan he is. &nbsp;The American Counseling Association, the alleged &ldquo;perpetrator&rdquo; of the &ldquo;hate crime&rdquo;, expelled him for ethical reasons and brought attention to his financial gain from the sale of DVDs, books and other instructional materials. These materials &ldquo;claim&hellip; gay people don&rsquo;t have to be that way if they don&rsquo;t want to be.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn90" name="_ftnref90" title=""><span><span><span>[70]</span></span></span></a> Lively, Schmierer and Cohen are nutcases that diminish traditional conservatives. They are paranoid, right-wing lunatic fringe leaders.</p>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Melissa Harris-Lacewell, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writer" title="Writer"><span>writer</span></a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science" title="Political science">political scientist</a>, and an Associate Professor of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics" title="Politics">Politics</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American_studies" title="African American studies">African American studies</a> at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University" title="Princeton University">Princeton University</a>, compared the United States&rsquo; credibility gap relative to the drone attacks<a href="#_ftn101" name="_ftnref101" title=""><span><span><span><span>[81]</span></span></span></span></a> with its discrepancy between words and actions on homophobia, when she briefly discussed <i>The</i> <i>Anti Homosexuality Bill</i> &nbsp;with Rachel Maddow. &ldquo;In a country [USA] where members of Congress represent districts and states where people who are gay and transgendered can be kicked out of their rental housing, can be denied job opportunities, can lose custody of their children depending on the state, in a place where we have impassioned speeches about the rights to marry that are ignored by other members of a state legislature, where it is possible that Washington, D.C.&lsquo;s marriage equality will be turned back by our very Congress, we have set an international tone indicating that gay, lesbian and transgendered people are second class citizens even in our own country.&nbsp; So it becomes very, very difficult for us to moralize on these questions abroad.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn102" name="_ftnref102" title=""><span><span><span>[82]</span></span></span></a> The Family&rsquo;s ubiquitous involvement in Uganda has been well documented thanks to people of consequence such as Jeff Sharlet, Rachel Maddow, and Terry Gross <b>(supra </b>note 71).</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Populist evangelical ministers also have a presence in Uganda. The most egregious example is California mega-church uber-pastor and best selling author (<i>The Purpose Driven Life</i>) Rick Warren. Yes, he is the same reverend that President-elect Barack Obama and his team selected to deliver the inaugural prayer. More than a few Obama supporters including human and gay rights activists and organizations were displeased and demanded that Warren be uninvited because of his social conservative beliefs. Warren supported Proposition 8 in California, a ballot initiative reversing same-sex marriage, compared homosexuality to pedophilia and bestiality, and backed other right-wing wedge issues such as his anti-choice stance on abortion and his advocacy for condom-free/abstinence-only faith based initiatives (instead of science-based programs that had already reaped excellent results) to combat not only unwanted pregnancy, but also AIDS in Africa. The Obama administration cited Warren&rsquo;s work on AIDS in Africa to combat this understandable ground-swell of criticism from backers. Warren prevailed and was allowed to lead the inaugural prayer, but the merciless press and implacable progressives continued to intensively scrutinize this occasionally taciturn pastor&rsquo;s controversial faith-based activities both at home and abroad.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This probe into the unbeknownst darker side of Warren&rsquo;s life eventually produced disgusting results. Martin Ssempa, a charismatic pastor with close ties to Uganda&rsquo;s First Lady, Janet Museveni, is Warren&rsquo;s man there. &ldquo;In the capitol of Kampala, Ssempa is known for his boisterous crusading. Ssempa&rsquo;s stunts have included burning condoms in the name of Jesus and arranging the publication of names of homosexuals in cooperative local newspapers while lobbying for criminal penalties to imprison them&hellip; When Warren unveiled his global AIDS initiative at a 2005 conference at his Saddleback Church, he cast Ssempa as his indispensable sidekick, assigning him to lead a breakout session on abstinence-only education as well as a seminar on AIDS prevention. Later, Ssempa delivered a keynote address, a speech so stirring it &lsquo;had the audience on the edge of its seats,&rsquo; according to Warren&rsquo;s public relations agency. A year later, Ssempa returned to Saddleback Church to lead another seminar on AIDS. By this time, his bond with the Warrens had grown almost familial. &lsquo;You are my brother, Martin, and I love you,&rsquo; Rick Warren&rsquo;s wife, Kay, said to Ssempa from the stage. Her voice trembled with emotion as she spoke and tears ran down her cheeks.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn103" name="_ftnref103" title=""><span><span><span><span>[83]</span></span></span></span></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Warren, Ssempa and the Family did not just persecute safe sex advocates in Uganda. &nbsp;Ssempa led fear inducing marches through Kampala demanding that Museveni&rsquo;s government impose harsh punishments on gays. Intimidating placards read: &ldquo;<a href="http://74.125.45.132/search?q=cache:cUU3wLMA2HAJ:naijasagba.blospot.com/+Ssempa,gay,riot&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;strip=1" target="_blank">Arrest all homos</a>&rdquo; and &ldquo;A man cannot marry a man.&rdquo; Ssempa created a Website to list the names, addresses and photos of gay rights activists. He wrongfully denounced them for promoting homosexuality and seducing children. Warren has denied being homophobic. He told NBC&rsquo;s Ann Curry, the news anchor on the <i>Today</i> morning television program, in an interview that &ldquo;I have always treated them with respect. When they come and want to talk to me, I talk to them.&rdquo; This is hypocrisy pure and simple; Warren backed Uganda&rsquo;s Anglican bishops when they repudiated the Church of England&rsquo;s tolerant, inclusive treatment of homosexuals. At the time [March of 2008] Warren said: &ldquo;The Church of England is wrong&hellip; I support the Church  of Uganda on the boycott&hellip;&rdquo; He also emphatically stated that homosexuality is &ldquo;an unnatural way of life&rdquo;, which the church must disallow.<a href="#_ftn104" name="_ftnref104" title=""><span><span><span>[84]</span></span></span></a></div>
<div>After weeks of negative press coverage, multi-sector pressure and growing public contempt for not having criticized <i>The</i> <i>Anti Homosexuality Bill</i>, Warren distanced himself from Ssempa and then made public a videotaped message that he addressed to pastors in Uganda. On December 10, 2009 he condemned this draconian Bill that would criminalize homosexuality in Uganda, particularly its imposition of the death penalty, which he called &ldquo;unjust and un-Christian.&rdquo; Many spheres praised Warren, but the pastors in Uganda&mdash;his former friend Ssempa included&mdash;were infuriated. In response to Warren&rsquo;s turnabout, these ministers organized the Uganda National Pastors Task Force against Homosexuality that sent him a culpatory email message insisting that he &ldquo;issue a formal apology for insulting the people of Africa&hellip; As you yourself have said, &lsquo;the Bible says evil has to be opposed. Evil has to be stopped. The Bible does not say negotiate with evil. It says stop it. Stop evil.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn105" name="_ftnref105" title=""><span><span><span>[85]</span></span></span></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Warren claims that he had not spoken out earlier because &ldquo;it is not [his] role to interfere with the politics of other nations.&rdquo; His initial position mirrored what cagey Family member-politicians unrighteously opined at the beginning. &nbsp;Recently Warren acknowledged that he was mistaken because the criminalization of homosexuality in Uganda is &ldquo;a moral issue&rdquo; and pastors in Uganda that he mentors &ldquo;look to [him] for guidance.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn106" name="_ftnref106" title=""><span><span><span>[86]</span></span></span></a> Will Warren&rsquo;s dilatory rebuke be enough to restore halcyon times in Uganda?</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that the otherwise closemouthed members of the Family (elite fundamentalists) have belatedly<a href="#_ftn107" name="_ftnref107" title=""><span><span><span>[87]</span></span></span></a> and halfheartedly<a href="#_ftn108" name="_ftnref108" title=""><span><span><span>[88]</span></span></span></a> criticized <i>The Anti Homosexuality Bill </i>that Bahati introduced in the Ugandan parliament (<b>supra</b>), what has the Ugandan government done? Its populist evangelical minister friends from the United States with intimate, but until now unobserved, ties to Uganda, after considerable delay, have amelioratively denounced <i>The Anti Homosexuality Bill</i>. However, the most demoralizing recreants for Bahati, the homophobic Ugandan Member of Parliament, and his ilk were the three homophobic &ldquo;ex-gays&rdquo; (and their respective sponsorial entities)<a href="#_ftn109" name="_ftnref109" title=""><span><span><span>[89]</span></span></span></a> that ruefully backtracked. They are the rascals who set <i>The Anti Homosexuality Bill</i> ball rolling in the first place when they attended the &ldquo;gay agenda&rdquo; seminar that Stephen Langa, the executive director of the Family Life Network in Uganda, organized (<b>supra </b>note 67). Its express purpose was: Expose the &ldquo;threat&rdquo; homosexuals pose to Bible-based and traditional African family values. These pusillanimous &ldquo;traitors&rdquo; of the anti-gay agenda had vilified homosexuals at this seminar in Uganda (<b>supra </b>note 89). They promoted their lunatic fringe ideas and plugged their lucrative money-making books, videos, and other outrageous wares there. Yes, these religious/cultural/economic imperialists who gleefully characterized the onerous &ldquo;white man&rsquo;s burden&rdquo; [<i>circa </i>1899/Rudyard Kipling&rsquo;s satirical poem undermining imperialism] fearfully jumped ship stranding the government of Uganda to confront the burgeoning international furor over <i>The Anti Homosexuality Bill</i>. &nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On January 2, 2010, the Ethics and Integrity Minister of Uganda, <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=James+Nsaba+Buturo&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1">James Nsaba Buturo</a>, said that <i>The Anti Homosexuality Bill </i>will be debated in parliament within the next three weeks. The same day, the Kampala-based <i><a href="http://www.monitor.co.ug/" target="_blank">Daily Monitor</a></i> newspaper reported that the Ugandan government may try to convince Bahati, the sponsor-member, who originally tabled the proposal in October 2009, to withdraw it because of heightening pressure from the international community.<a href="#_ftn110" name="_ftnref110" title=""><span><span><span>[90]</span></span></span></a> Notwithstanding, Buturo, in a concomitant telephone interview declared: &ldquo;The matter is beyond our [the Ugandan government&rsquo;s] hands and we can&rsquo;t interfere with the work of parliament.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn111" name="_ftnref111" title=""><span><span><span>[91]</span></span></span></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Buturo recently stated that Museveni (<b>supra</b>) informed colleagues that &ldquo;he thinks the proposed bill is too harsh.&rdquo; Furthermore, he supposedly urged his National Resistance Movement Party to strike the provision in <i>The Anti Homosexuality Bill </i>mandating the death penalty for sexually active homosexuals who are HIV+, recidivists, and perpetrators of same-sex rape. Museveni still has not revealed whether he supports life imprisonment for gays,<a href="#_ftn112" name="_ftnref112" title=""><span><span><span>[92]</span></span></span></a> another punishment option in <i>The</i> <i>Anti Homosexuality Bill</i>. Buturo said: &quot;The death penalty is likely to be removed&hellip;&quot; He added: &quot;The president doesn't believe in killing gays. I also don't believe in it. I think gays can be counseled and they stop the bad habit.&quot; Mary Karoro Okurut, a member of Museveni&rsquo;s party, also opposes the death penalty, but she pledged to support <i>The Anti Homosexuality Bill</i> when it voted on in Parliament. She argued that homosexuality &quot;is not allowed in African culture&rdquo; [<b>supra </b>note 58] and alleged that <i>The Anti Homosexuality Bill </i>has to stay because the Ugandan government has &quot;to protect the children in schools who are being recruited into homosexual activities.&quot; Sex Minorities Uganda&rsquo;s head Frank Mugisha announced that he will support Museveni&rsquo;s reelection in 2011; elimination of the death penalty provision is enough to assure his gay rights organization's endorsement.<a href="#_ftn113" name="_ftnref113" title=""><span><span><span>[93]</span></span></span></a></div>
<div>Elizabeth Mataka, the U.N. Special Envoy on AIDS in Africa, queried: &ldquo;Who will go to HIV testing if he knows that he will suffer the death sentence? The law will drive them [homosexuals] away from seeking counseling and testing services.&quot; Homosexuality became illegal in Uganda under colonial-era laws.<sup> <a href="#_ftn114" name="_ftnref114" title=""><sup><span>[94]</span></sup></a></sup> <span>The colonial powers brought a lot of sexual taboos including the criminalization of homosexuality to most of the Third World Uganda inclusive, but now they have decriminalized homosexuality and are gradually granting equal rights to homosexuals at home while homosexuality is still typified as a crime in most of the former colonies including Uganda. <i>The</i> <i>Anti- Homosexuality Bill </i>under Ugandan Parliament&rsquo;s consideration &ldquo;is intended to put more teeth into prosecuting violators.&rdquo; It</span>would also have extraterritorial effect &ldquo;&hellip;to Ugandans participating in same-sex acts in countries where such behavior is legal. &lsquo;They [Ugandans who are homosexuals] are supposed to be brought back to Uganda and convicted here. The government is putting homosexuality on the level of treason,&quot; Frank Mugisha, the gay Chairperson of Sexual Minorities in Uganda complained. Ugandan legislators indicate that they will pass <i>The</i> <i><span>Anti Homosexuality Bill</span></i>. &ldquo;It has the blessing of many religious leaders&mdash;Muslim and Christian &mdash;in a country where a July poll found 95 percent [of Ugandan citizens are] opposed to legalizing homosexuality.&rdquo; Esau Omara, an Episcopal provost to Boroboro Cathedral in the Lira district of Uganda's Lango region, said &ldquo;any lawmaker opposing the bill will pay for it during the next election... And a leading Muslim cleric, Sheikh Ramathan Shaban Mubajje, has called for gays to be rounded up and banished to an island until they die.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn115" name="_ftnref115" title=""><span><span><span><span>[95]</span></span></span></span></a></div>
<div>On January 7, 2010, the Ugandan Minister of State for Investment, Aston Kajara said that the government &ldquo;fears backlash from foreign investors&rdquo; over <i>The</i> <i>Anti Homosexuality Bill </i>that Bahati proposed last year because it &ldquo;has provoked criticism from gay rights groups and protests in London, New York and Washington&hellip; [It] tarnishes Uganda's image.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn116" name="_ftnref116" title=""><span><span><span>[96]</span></span></span></a></div>

As followers of the teachings of Christ, we must express profound dismay at a bill currently before the Parliament in Uganda.&quot; It was inspired by a declaration by Episcopal Church Presiding <a href="http://content.usatoday.com/topics/topic/Religion+and+beliefs/Leaders,+Experts/Katharine+Jefferts+Schori" target="_blank">Bishop Katharine Jefferts Schor</a>i, elected Presiding Bishop of The Episcopal Church in June 2006&mdash;she serves as Chief Pastor and Primate to the members of the Episcopal Church in sixteen (16) countries and a hundred and ten (110) dioceses that seek to make common cause for global good and reconciliation&mdash;who said: &ldquo;attempts to export the culture wars of North America to another context represent the very worst of colonial behavior.&nbsp; We deeply lament this reality, and repent of any way in which we have participated in this sin.&rdquo; Her declaration intimates that the Family (especially Senator Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma) &ldquo;is reputedly the architect of Uganda's anti-homosexuality bill, which would use the East African nation as a theocratic experiment in its 70-yeat [sic] quest for absolute power and world domination&rdquo; as revealed in Jeff Sharlet's book, <a href="http://www.harpercollins.com/books/9780060559793/The_Family/index.aspx" target="_blank"><i>The Family:&nbsp; The Secret Fundamentalism At The Heart Of American Power.</i></a> None of the joint statement's signatories are associated with the Family; &ldquo;so it would seem something of a Holy War is brewing here in the U.S. based on the Family's principles and global reach, and Christians who oppose its ideals and actions in other parts of the world.&rdquo;<sup> <a href="#_ftn117" name="_ftnref117" title=""><span><span><span>[97]</span></span></span></a></sup></div>
<div>Peter Tatchell of OutRage! (<b>Supra </b>note 94) summarized <i>The</i> <i>Anti-Homosexuality Bill </i>that is pending approval: It &ldquo;proposes the death penalty for two classes of same-sex acts.&rdquo;</div>
<div><b>&middot;</b> &ldquo;First, for 'aggravated' homosexuality, which is defined as gay sex with under 18s or disabled persons and gay sex by a person in authority or by a person with HIV, even if they use a condom.&rdquo;</div>
<div><b>&middot;</b> &ldquo;Second, for 'serial' homosexual acts, meaning for persons who have repeated same-sex relations ie. [sic] more than once or twice.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Tatchell emphasized: &ldquo;The Bill extends the existing penalty of life imprisonment for same-sex intercourse to all other same-sex behaviour [sic/British variant], including the mere touching of another person with the intent to have homosexual relations. Life imprisonment is also the penalty for contracting a same-sex marriage. Promoting homosexuality and aiding and abetting others to commit homosexual acts will be punishable by five to seven years jail. These new crimes are likely to include membership and funding of LGBT organisations [sic/British variant], advocacy of LGBT human rights, supportive counselling [sic/British variant] of LGBT persons and the provision of condoms or safer sex advice to LGBT people. A person in authority&mdash;gay or heterosexual&mdash;who fails to report violators to the police within 24 hours will be sentenced to three years behind bars. Astonishingly, the new legislation has an extra-territorial jurisdiction. It will also apply to Ugandan citizens or foreign residents of Uganda who commit these 'crimes' while abroad, in countries where such behaviour is not a criminal offence. Violators overseas will be subjected to extradition, trial and punishment in Uganda. This bill is even more draconian than the extreme homophobic laws of countries like Saudi Arabia and Iran. It is part of a wide attack on civil society and is symptomatic of Uganda&rsquo;s drift to Mugabe-style* authoritarianism&hellip;&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn118" name="_ftnref118" title=""><span><span><span>[98]</span></span></span></a> *[means: gaining control of government, disregarding democratic principles, and keeping power]</div>
<div><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The</i> <i>Anti-Homosexuality Bill</i> is currently tabled in committee prior to its second reading in parliament, which is scheduled for late February or early March. It may be amended yet, but it is widely expected to become law soon thereafter.<a href="#_ftn119" name="_ftnref119" title=""><span><span><span><span>[99]</span></span></span></span></a> Bahati recently announced that he plans to attend the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington,  D.C., on February 4, 2010.<a href="#_ftn120" name="_ftnref120" title=""><span><span><span><span>[100]</span></span></span></span></a> At once, CREW (Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington) urged the White House to pull away from President Obama&rsquo;s earlier commitment to attend the Family&rsquo;s National Prayer Breakfast.&nbsp;&nbsp;Melanie Sloan, CREW&rsquo;s director, expressed her organization&rsquo;s dissatisfaction: &quot;The president and members of Congress should not legitimatize this cult-like group&mdash;the head of which [Doug Coe] has praised the organizing abilities of Hitler and Bin Laden&mdash;by attending the breakfast.&quot;<a href="#_ftn121" name="_ftnref121" title=""><span><span><span><span>[101]</span></span></span></span></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The White House brushed CREW&rsquo;s admonition aside, and once more President Obama attended the National Prayer Breakfast. Notwithstanding, President Obama incidentally touched on <i>The Anti Homosexuality Bill </i>when he informed those attending the event: &quot;We can take different approaches to ending inequality, but surely we can agree on the need to lift our children out of ignorance, to lift our neighbors out of poverty. We may disagree about gay marriage, but surely we can agree that it is unconscionable to target gays and lesbians for who they are, whether it is here in the United States or, as [Secretary of State] Hillary [Clinton]<a href="#_ftn122" name="_ftnref122" title=""><span><span><span><span>[102]</span></span></span></span></a> mentioned, more extremely in odious laws that are being proposed most recently in Uganda.&quot;<a href="#_ftn123" name="_ftnref123" title=""><span><span><span>[103]</span></span></span></a></div>
<div>President Obama&rsquo;s cursory denunciation of <i>The Anti Homosexuality Bill</i> at the National Prayer Breakfast seems to have exerted some pressure on Uganda&rsquo;s government. After he referred to it as an &ldquo;odious law&rdquo;, Deputy Foreign Minister Henry Okello Oryem told the BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation): &quot;I am sure the bill will take a different form&hellip; Oryem did not give specific details about the potential changes, but he added that the government would not have power to make alterations while it remains a private member&rsquo;s bill&hellip; David Bahati, the bill&rsquo;s sponsor, said two weeks ago that he is willing to &lsquo;amend some clauses,&rsquo; according to the BBC. A cabinet committee is examining his proposals.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn124" name="_ftnref124" title=""><span><span><span><span>[104]</span></span></span></span></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; William Tells shares CREW&rsquo;s position on the president&rsquo;s imprimatur of the Family&rsquo;s National Prayer Breakfast: President Obama should decline all future invitations to attend this elite fundamentalist group&rsquo;s National Prayer Breakfast thereby ending this insidious habit that President Eisenhower was boxed into in 1954.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div align="center"><b>E. 3-WAY WRAP-UP</b></div>
<div align="center">&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part Two of Worldly Power: Family Style, The National Prayer Breakfast and its Offshoots, the last of a tripartite series, was preceded by The Other FBI (<b>F</b>aith-<b>B</b>ased <b>I</b>nitiatives) and Part One of Worldly Power: Family Style, The Prayer Group Movement. Those who read this series know that faith-based initiatives and &ldquo;compassionate&rdquo; conservatism are interconnected. Both secretively move together waging war on their putative enemy, secularism. Fundamentalist religion and right-wing politics meld together to form a movement that operates nationally and internationally. Its origin can be traced to the Prison Fellowship. Traditionally evangelical Christians worked for the poor and the suffering, but this changed in the early part of the twentieth century. Their &ldquo;Social Gospel&rdquo; was radically revised.&nbsp;Today good works are disdained; all the poor needs is Jesus. The Prison Fellowship&rsquo;s founder, felon Charles Colson of Watergate infamy, and his &ldquo;brothers&rdquo; are members of the Family. In both the United States and Puerto  Rico, faith-based initiatives threaten the doctrine of separation of church and state, which incorporates two established democratic principles, secular government and religious freedom.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Part One of Worldly Power: Family Style, William Tells revealed how the Family or Fellowship, a core of elite religious fundamentalists that wants to change the world, takes the same approach to religion that Ronald Reagan took to economics. The Family, founded by Abraham Vereide and currently headed by Doug Coe, professes: &ldquo;Reach the elite, and the blessings will trickle down to the underlings.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn125" name="_ftnref125" title=""><span><span><span>[105]</span></span></span></a> This group of elite fundamentalists includes evangelicals, Pentecostals, Roman Catholics, and an assortment of right-wing politicians that Jeff Sharlet dubs the avant-garde of American fundamentalism in <i>The Family</i>, his bestseller about the secret fundamentalism at the heart of American power. Vereide&rsquo;s <i>Idea</i> for the prayer group movement emerged from his hate for labor unions and communism. The two groups that typify this movement are prayer breakfasts and cells. Initially it was tempered: Conservative Democratic and moderate Republican politicians who genuinely believed in the doctrine of separation of church and state and practiced bipartisanship participated. This started to change when right-wing Republican Ronald Reagan pioneered the use of wedge issues and favored the rarefied elite, big economic interests and the super-wealthy. For example, he campaigned as <b>anti-</b> big government, welfare state, abortion and civil rights; and<b> pro-</b>tax cuts, death penalty, states&rsquo; rights, unbridled militarism and war on drugs. Many of his wedge issues&nbsp;appealed not only to the GOP base, but also to enough conservative Democrats and independents for him to be elected Governor of California and President twice apiece. Most of what recently has gone wrong in the United States and abroad including the sub prime mortgage crisis and the meltdown of the financial sector can be traced to discredited Reaganomics (a/k/a trickle-down or supply-side economics) that failed to translate into jobs for the poor and middle wage earning classes at home; instead the enterprises of the super-rich outsourced their work and too many jobs were moved overseas. Neoconservatives meet both at <img hspace="5" height="329" width="450" vspace="5" border="0" align="right" src="/images/stories/queeritics/william_tells/worldy_power_2/Uganda_ParliamentX390.jpg" alt="The Parliament of the Republic of Uganda" />ubiquitous prayer breakfasts and imperceptible prayer groups for the elite. They are pejoratively referred to as crony capitalists, businessmen whose success depends on favoritism from government officials that far too often devolves into corruption.&nbsp;Some attend weekend worldview conferences and right-wing mass rallies to preach hate and fear, appeal to poor and middle class wage earners&rsquo; prejudice and chauvinism, indoctrinate them into a simplistic, divisive credendum of life that fuses church and state, promote creationism (a/k/a &ldquo;intelligent design&rdquo; and generally misinform them in order to garner support for compromised right-wing political candidates who support disadvantageous, elitist economic and social policies that benefit the super-rich and prejudice the poor and middle classes. Too many like-minded politicians sell their votes to special interests in exchange for campaign contributions or &ldquo;sweetheart&rdquo; deals.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; William Tells animates Papel Mag&rsquo;s readers to become progressive independent voters who analyze party platforms and evaluate all the candidates for political office beforehand. Part Two dissected the so-called National Prayer Breakfast and its sordid Offshoots. Much more could be said about both the populist and the elitist branches of Christian fundamentalism and the sinister worldview that they share. The ominous situation in Uganda concerning <i>The Anti Homosexuality Bill</i> is unresolved; therefore, however much William Tells is disposed to introducing new themes early-on in 2010, depending on what finally transpires in Uganda&rsquo;s parliament, a follow-up on this human rights crisis may be requisite.</div>

Jeff Sharlet, the author of <i>The Family </i>replied that he didn&rsquo;t: &ldquo;&hellip;think any U.S. president should attend a privately organized and funded sectarian event, secretly presided over by a leader who is on record and on video talking about the leadership lessons of Hitler. The planning documents of this ostensibly ecumenical event declare: &lsquo;Anything can happen, the Koran could even be read, but JESUS is there! He is infiltrating the world.&rsquo; Citizens are entitled to that view. But they're not entitled to de facto government endorsement of it.<br />
The first president to attend, Eisenhower, did so under political pressure and said he hoped it wouldn't become a tradition. It might not have had the next president, John F. Kennedy, not been compelled to attend to prove to evangelicals that his Catholicism wouldn't be a barrier between them. It's worth noting that Jackie refused to go. Every president since has found in the Prayer Breakfast a platform for publicly banal and privately powerful engagements with American religious figures and the foreign leaders the Family chooses to invite to the many off-the-record events that surround the breakfast. This simply isn't a &lsquo;National Prayer Breakfast&rsquo;; it's a lobbyist's dream. If the American people want a National Prayer Breakfast, fine &mdash; let Congress appropriate funds and designate a national-level agency to run it. And let the Supreme Court deal with the First Amendment issues that will follow.&rdquo; Harmon, Andrew. <i>Family Expert Jeff Sharlet on Uganda </i>( Posted December 21, 2009). Advocate.com.

Furthermore, the address of the President of the United States of America at this gathering is reprehensible; however unwittingly, it underpins the semblance of assumed governmental auspices, which is derived surreptitiously from the President&rsquo;s address and the use of &ldquo;National&rdquo; in this get-together&rsquo;s name. William Tells surmises that the former use of &ldquo;Presidential&rdquo; (<b>supra </b>note 21) was changed to &ldquo;National&rdquo; to clarify that the President has nothing to do with the organization (the Family) or the hosting (members of the Family who are in Congress) of this event.</div>

<div>1. Sudan is located in North Africa, south of Egypt.</div>
<div>2. Khartoum is the capital of Sudan.</div>
<div>3. The president of Sudan is General Omar al-Bashir.</div>
<div>4. Darfur is a region in western Sudan, about the size of Texas.</div>
<div>5. Most of the residents of Darfur are Muslims.</div>
<div>6. Some Darfurians speak Arabic and identify as Arabs; others speak African dialects and identify as Africans. Many of the African Darfurians belong to the Fur, Massalit and Zaghawa tribes.</div>
<div>7. The conflict in Sudan was sparked when rebels from Darfur attacked a government air force base in 2003. The rebels are mostly people from the Fur, Massalit and Zaghawa tribes. For years they have felt ignored by the central government in Khartoum.</div>
<div>8. In retaliation for this attack, Sudan&rsquo;s military and the government-backed militias, the Janjaweed, have attacked the African residents of Darfur. Reports indicate that they have burned villages, murdered and maimed residents, poisoned wells, raped women, stolen animals and other valuables, and kidnapped children.</div>
<div>9. The United Nations estimates that since 2003 at least 200,000 Darfurians have been killed.</div>
<div>10. The United Nations estimates that since 2003 at least 2.5 million Darfurians have been forced to leave their villages due to the violence in the region. Most of these people live in IDP [Internally Displaced Persons] camps in Darfur or refugee camps in Chad.</div>

Internationally he has been hailed as a star among &ldquo;a new breed of [&ldquo;uncorrupt&rdquo;] African leaders&rdquo; that govern &ldquo;democratically&rdquo;.

The Uganda Spring 2009 Update that is prepared by the Whitaker Group paints a rosy future: &ldquo;With the strong support of the Government of Uganda and the imminent arrival of global connectivity via the SEACOM fiber optic undersea cable, Uganda is poised to make a serious bid to become the business process outsourcing (BPO) hub of East Africa. The country, blessed with political stability, a population proficient in English, a large and inexpensive labor pool with information technology (IT) skills and an attractive business environment, is well positioned to provide a host of services to a global clientele.&rdquo; Needless to say, there is no mention of genocide or human rights violations in this Whitaker Group publication. Notwithstanding, a posting on UWIRE, a wire service powered by student journalists attending colleges and universities across the United States, which was distributed to Yahoo and other professional media outlets, claims that &ldquo;under President Museveni&rsquo;s guidance, horrific war crimes have been committed in the Great Lakes region, and continuing human rights violations in Uganda are slowly claiming the lives of millions.

For the past 20 years, the region has been ravaged by a violent civil war in which over 30,000 children were abducted to be used as child soldiers and nearly 2 million people have been forced from their homes into Internally Displaced Persons [IDP] camps. The results of this war have been devastating. The Acholi tribe makes up nearly the entire population of Northern Uganda. After two decades of displacement and violence, their traditional agrarian culture has been all but decimated. At one point, nearly 90 percent of the population was living in displacement camps where they were entirely dependant on the U.N. World Food Programme [sic/British variant] to sustain them. Despite these facts, none of these statistics really seem to be news to anybody. People in the west are bombarded by tragic numbers from Africa constantly. This is nothing new. Northern Uganda has received a large amount of international attention through several Documentaries and social justice movements. These programs have chosen to highlight past atrocities in the region in an effort to raise awareness for the problems the population is facing. While there is truth in the past, there is hope in the future.&rdquo; Anderson, Nick. <i>Acholi Crossroads</i> (January 2009). Vimeo.

It provides: &ldquo;A person commits an offense if he engages in deviate sexual intercourse with another individual of the same sex.&rdquo; The statute defined deviate sexual intercourse as follows: &ldquo;(A) any contact between any part of the genitals of one person and the mouth or anus of another person; or (B) the penetration of the genitals or the anus of another person with an object.&rdquo; &sect;21.01(1). These identical forms of sexual intercourse with an individual of the opposite sex were legal in Texas at the time&mdash;when police entered Lawrence&rsquo;s apartment in response to a &ldquo;reported&rdquo; weapons disturbance and observed him and Garner engaging in a consensual sexual act in the privacy of the home. They were arrested, held in custody over night, charged with deviate sexual intercourse under <i>The Texas Homosexual Conduct Law</i> and convicted before a Justice of the Peace. The petitioners exercised their right to a trial <i>de novo </i>in Harris County Criminal Court. They challenged the statute as a violation of the Equal Protection Clauses of United States and Texas Constitutions. Those contentions were rejected. On appeal the Texas Fourteenth District Court of Appeals considered their federal constitutional arguments under both the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. After hearing the case in banc, the majority rejected the constitutional arguments and affirmed the criminal convictions. The petitioners filed a Petition for Certiorari before the United States Supreme Court.

And of course, U.S. conservatives exploit and encourage this belief. Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, whose wife is a close ally of [Reverend] Rick Warren, warned, &lsquo;It is a danger not only to the believers but to the whole of Africa. It is bad if our children become complacent and think that people who are not in order [code for: homosexuals and lesbians] are alright&hellip; These foreigners should go and practice their nonsense elsewhere.&rsquo; [Milton Olupot and Daniel Edyegu, <i><a href="http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/12/644954" target="_blank"><span>Museveni backs church against gays</span></a>,</i>&nbsp;Sunday Vision, August 17, 2008]. Because Africans are sensitive to neocolonialism, the conservative claim that homosexuality is part of a &quot;Western agenda&quot; gives African church leaders ammunition to demand greater influence and power in the affairs of the church. Denouncing homosexuality is Africa's way of claiming power over the western world. In this regard, when Africans claim that homosexuality is un-African, they are pointing to a politics of postcolonial identity. [Miranda K. Hassett,&nbsp;Anglican Communion in Crisis: How Episcopal Dissidents and Their African Allies Are Reshaping Anglicanism, (Princeton, NJ:&nbsp; Princeton University Press, 2007), p. 13.] This history gives the struggle greater depth and tenacity, and for that reason, African involvement in U.S. church issues will continue. Moreover, rejecting what is claimed to be an imposition from the West gives them power both within the African context and with American conservatives of all persuasions. Ironically enough, although American conservatives repeatedly accuse progressives of being imperialist, it is their dealings with Africa that are extremely imperialistic. Their flow of funds creates a form of clientelism, with the expectation that the recipients toe an ideological line.&rdquo; Kaoma, Kapya.&nbsp;<i>The U.S. Christian Right and the Attack on Gays in Africa</i>.

As Spectrum Uganda activist Sam Ganafa declared, &lsquo;The new bill will instill [sic] fear because it touches almost everybody. Even a journalist now asking me about this, after it passes will not be able to do it. You will be discussing a subject that must not be discussed at all. Your family will be compelled by law to turn you in.&rsquo; Furthermore, human rights advocates and lawyers have already asserted the purported illegality of the bill saying it attempts to circumvent and thus nullify the numerous international treaties and covenants already ratified by the country. On a recent radio debate, Christine Butegwa, regional coordinator for Akina Mama wa Afrika, one of the 23 organizations partnering in opposition to the bill, asserted that &lsquo;the bill has nothing new to offer. It is indeed a waste of tax payers&rsquo; money because the majority of the provisions in the bill are actually provided for in other laws already in existence in Uganda.&rsquo; Furthermore, as Makerere law lecturer Dr Sylvia Tamale noted, it is clear the author of this bill was no lawyer because it is in direct violation of numerous tenants of the 1995 constitution and legally Parliament has neither the power to nullify treaties or constitutional provisions. Indeed, one of the key consultants of the bill is not a lawyer at all, but prominent &ldquo;pro-family&rdquo; pastor, Martin Ssempa [Rick and Kay Warren&rsquo;s &ldquo;brother&rdquo; and &ldquo;indispensable sidekick&rdquo; in their Global AIDS Initiative in Uganda (<b>infra</b>)]. On the same radio broadcast last week, Ssempa repeatedly touched upon the overarching threats he believes this bill is attempting to remedy: the assault upon African culture and the erosion of family values alongside fears of increased incidences of homosexual recruitment and defilement and their seeming lack of legal consequences. Ssempa argued that, contrary to criticism that the bill unfairly targets homosexuals, it would in effect bring about equal protection under the law for both boys and girls, who are the prime targets for molestation and defilement. In a recent interview, Ssempa went much further, &lsquo;I think it is important to understand what sodomy is. It is inherently unhealthy, a sexual lifestyle that involves unmentionable acts.&rsquo; He went on to note that &lsquo;by and large many boys and men have been infected and had permanent damage from homosexual behavior. And homosexual men have a higher risk for disease.&rsquo;&hellip; Ultimately, the fear for many human rights defenders is the erosion of a human rights culture in Uganda and the broad ways in which this bill can be used to target many more than just the small gay population. As Val Kalende, a journalist and activist for SMUG (Sexual Minorities Uganda) noted, &lsquo;This is not all about sex. We are talking about the right for people to be employed, the right to access services equally, the right to justice and the right to freedom of speech and expression.&rsquo; Pastor Ssempa and MP [Member of Parliament] Bahati (<b>supra/infra</b>) however think otherwise, both deeply worried about the undue influence&hellip; of Western decadence and permissiveness seen as decimating African culture and tearing apart the moral fabric of society.&rdquo; Rubin, Ariel. <i>Anti-gay bill opens a Pandora&rsquo;s Box</i> (November 10, 2009).

There was some pushback&hellip; it&rsquo;s important to acknowledge that members of the Family sort of expressed some disapproval of it, but in the balance, as one Family associate explained to me, there&rsquo;s always a balance between access and accountability, access to power and holding power accountable. In that instance, they [the Family members present] seemed to prefer continuing the access to power of these Ugandan officials rather than stepping in and nipping that thing [the &ldquo;kill the gays&rdquo; bill] in the bud.&rdquo; Rachel Maddow interviewed Family expert Jeff Sharlet about the Uganda National Prayer Breakfast and its Family ties. <i>MSNBC,</i> 2009 (updated December 10, 2009).

<div><a href="#_ftnref84" name="_ftn84" title=""><span><span><span><span>[64]</span></span></span></span></a> Rachel Maddow interviewed investigative reporter Mark Benjamin, national correspondent for Salon.com, who in 2005 assumed the identity of a gay man for the purpose of exposing the ex-gay myth&mdash;the religious right&rsquo;s agenda to deny gay and lesbian identity through the pretense that sexual orientation is &ldquo;chosen&rdquo; and &ldquo;changeable&mdash;and its concomitant multi-million dollar reparative therapy industry that maliciously depicts gays and lesbians as &ldquo;sick&rdquo; and &quot;sexually broken&quot;.&nbsp;The following excerpt from the interview is very revealing:</div>
<div>MADDOW:&nbsp; &ldquo;So, you wrote this four-part series about so-called reparative therapy for Salon.&nbsp; In the second part of the series, you actually pretended to be gay and sought counseling.&nbsp; What sort of therapy or counseling did you get?&rdquo;</div>
<div>BENJAMIN:&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, this reparative therapy comes in a number of flavors.&nbsp; I attended two times [sic] of conversion therapy sessions.&nbsp; One was free, it was held in the basement of a Christian church where there was a lot of praying, you know, group hugs and prayers.&nbsp; And they essentially cast the devil out of you, and they tell you if you still feel gay, you just basically not praying hard enough. The other was a sort of more advanced&hellip; kind of therapy where I went to a licensed counselor&lsquo;s office, sat in a comfortable chair, and met with this counselor.&nbsp; The basic supposition of this conversion therapy was that as a child&mdash;it was sort of Freudian in a way&mdash;&hellip; I apparently hadn&lsquo;t developed close enough or meaningful relationships with other males, and my sub-conscious later in life turned that into the desire to want to have sex with males. It was also fraught with a lot of bizarre stereotypes.&nbsp; For example, I was told that there was a correlation between poor eye-hand coordination and being gay.&nbsp; So, it was a very bizarre session.&rdquo;</div>
<div>MADDOW:&nbsp; &ldquo;Which&hellip; opens up a whole realm of videogame marketing presumably? In reporting this series, Mark, I know you also talked to a lot of people who had been through this sort of reparative therapy, not in an investigative way, but because they really did want to not be gay any more.&nbsp; Did you find any evidence, any people that suggested to you that it actually works?&rdquo;</div>
<div>BENJAMIN:&nbsp; &ldquo;I did not.&nbsp; I found people who claimed that it works, but they were all in the business.&nbsp; In other words, they were selling books.&nbsp; They were doing&hellip; work, like Richard Cohen does&hellip; allegedly, that it&lsquo;s to show that it works. So, I found people that were making money off it saying that it works, but what I did find was a lot of people who spent a lot of money and many, many years trying to reconcile their Christianity and the fact that they were homosexual&hellip;&nbsp; And there&lsquo;s a lot of&hellip; pain out there&hellip; [O]ne of the reasons I went undercover in the first place, it&lsquo;s the only time I&lsquo;ve ever done it in my career, [is] because I think there&lsquo;s a death toll here...&nbsp; I came across people who attempted suicide, and people who I was told who did commit suicide, because they tried and tried and tried to not be gay and they couldn&lsquo;t.&nbsp; And eventually, they didn&lsquo;t see any other way out.&nbsp; It&lsquo;s very, very troubling.&rdquo;</div>

<div>GROSS: &ldquo;So let's look at the Stupak-Pitts Amendment and its connection to The Family. This is the amendment to the House health care reform plan, and it prohibits the use of federal funds to pay for any abortion or to cover any part of the costs of any health plan that includes coverage of abortion.</div>
<div>So describe to us how Bart Stupak [Catholic] and Joe Pitts [Evangelical Christian] are connected to The Family.&rdquo;</div>
<div>Mr. SHARLET: &ldquo;Well, Bart Stupak is an interesting Democrat from Northern Michigan, and he&mdash;conservative in some ways, not as conservative in other ways, but on these family issues, he is. He's been living at what The Family calls their C Street House on Capitol Hill at least since 2002, when he told the Los Angeles Times&mdash;the Los Angeles Times was investigating The Family&mdash;he told them that he would not talk to the press about the house. That it was sort of secret. When I was living with The Family, which is sort of how I came to this whole story is by sort of reporting from within the group, Stupak was spoken of quite often as an ally of Joe Pitts; these are two guys who work well together&hellip; Stupak continues to live at the C Street House, although more recently, coming under scrutiny for that, he is trying to claim that he just rents a room in this house and doesn't know anything about the activities, despite the fact that the house is registered as a church.&rdquo;</div>
<div>GROSS: &ldquo;Although that status was just changed, wasn't it?&rdquo;</div>
<div>Mr. SHARLET: &ldquo;It was, it was. I think maybe as a result of some of the scrutiny this summer, a citizen of Washington, D.C., called the local tax office and said: Why is this $1.8 million townhouse being used to provide below-market housing for congressmen, basically to give them gifts and to, in an unofficial way, lobby them. Why is that tax-exempt and protected under a church [exoneration]? The tax office looked at it and agreed that 66 percent of the building was not properly tax-exempt. And so that portion, which includes Bart Stupak's room, was removed from that tax exemption.&rdquo;</div>
<div>GROSS: &ldquo;So what about Congressman Joe Pitts? What is his connection to The Family?&rdquo;</div>
<div>Mr. SHARLET: &ldquo;Joe Pitts has a much deeper and longer connection, going back to the 1970s, the early 1980s, when he was a state legislator in Pennsylvania, and he was a leader of the national state legislators&rsquo; anti-abortion organization. He has been a guy in the trenches of the abortion wars for 30 years. He is one of the strategists. He's one of the guys who helped sort of recruit Mother Teresa to the cause of American abortion politics, and he did that through The Family, actually, reaching out through the leader of The Family, a man named Doug Coe. Pitts is what The Family calls a core member. They have a very unusual theology in the sense that they think that Christ had one message for an inner circle and then a kind of different message for a sort of slightly more outer circle. And then the rest of us, Christ told us little stories because, frankly, we couldn't handle the truth. And the core members are those they think are getting the real deal. Pitts is part of that core of The Family that has been steering it and setting its agenda, if you want to put it like that, for many years.&rdquo; Gross, Terry (host). <i>The Secret Political Reach of &lsquo;The Family&rsquo; :NPR</i> (November 24, 2009).

The legislation, which also calls for executing Ugandans who test positive for HIV, is inconsistent with his commitment to traditional values, &lsquo;including how marriage is defined and respect for life&rsquo; &hellip;Grassley said he previously was unaware of the proposal &lsquo;beyond the news reporters who asked about it and the few constituents who contacted me&rsquo;&hellip;&nbsp;Bloomberg News reported Friday that Uganda may drop the death penalty and life imprisonment from the anti-homosexuality bill.&rdquo; Lynch, <a href="http://www.qctimes.com/search/?l=50&amp;sd=desc&amp;s=start_time&amp;f=html&amp;byline=James%20Q.%20Lynch"><span>James Q. </span></a>&nbsp;<i>Grassley condemns Uganda proposal </i>(Posted on December 13, 2009).

An enthusiastic born-again Christian, Scott testifies in his presentation of having been an alchoholic (sic) and drug addict from the age of 12 until his miraculous deliverance during prayer at age 28. <strong>Note:</strong> California is home to more homosexuals than anywhere else in the world, so it is interesting that Dr. Lively has hardly any strong following in any part of California, his home state, preferring to take his crusades to Lithuania and Uganda. 2. <strong>Mr. Don Schmierer</strong> from International Healing Ministries has apparently deciphered God's mind. Among some of the truisms he utters is&hellip; the following <a href="http://www.hisservants.net/">quote</a>: &lsquo;<em>Homosexuality results from the perception of rejection, real or imagined, by a child during his/her formative years. There is no gay gene! Homosexuality is not genetic, but a behavioral choice (though subconscious). The feeling of rejection as a human being comes in various forms - physical abuse, sexual abuse (including incest), verbal abuse, neglect (emotional abuse?), adultery, lack of affectionate touch, pornography, etc. Hormonal imbalance may also be a cause, though.&rsquo; </em>So, those of you planning to attend beware. If you have ever been verbally or physically abusive, have committed adultery, failed to touch others affectionately or have hormonal struggles, you will likely have homosexual children if<img hspace="5" height="269" width="200" vspace="5" border="0" align="right" src="/images/stories/queeritics/william_tells/worldy_power_2/Caleb-Lee-Brundidge.jpg" alt="Caleb Lee Brundidge" /> you haven't got them already. 3. <strong><a href="http://www.gaytostraight.org/ReferralTherapists.asp">Caleb Lee Brundidge</a></strong> is a dreadlocked 'former' homosexual who claims he is cured and now works as a mentor of homosexuals looking for a cure. He lived 15 years in Atlanta, Georgia (gay population 10,000+), then he moved to New Jersey (gay population 10,000+) to pursue ministry and healing opportunities. Brundidge met <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Cohen_%28lecturer%29">Richard Cohen</a> (Cohen was openly gay and had a boyfriend as an undergraduate, but spent years in intensive psychiatric treatment trying to change his sexual orientation) [International Healing Foundation (<b>supra </b>note 67<b>)</b>] at a NARTH conference (National Association for the Research and Therapy of Homosexuality). Being profoundly moved and impressed by Mr. Cohen&rsquo;s teaching, Caleb began a mentoring relationship with him and eventually experienced freedom from unwanted same-sex attraction (SSA). Brundidge is also associated with <a href="http://youthministries.wordpress.com/2008/07/27/club-mysterio/">Club Mysterio</a> whose website says it is: &lsquo;<em>a club where people (mostly young) come together and experience Ekstasis worship/dance... to create a Christian rave experience.

And I recently called President Museveni, whom I have known through the prayer breakfast, and expressed the strongest concerns about a law [<i>The Anti Homosexuality </i>Bill] being considered in the parliament of Uganda. We are committed, not only to reaching out and speaking up about the perversion of religion, and in particularly the use of it to promote and justify terrorism, but also seeking to find common ground. We are working with Muslim nations to come up with an appropriate way of demonstrating criticism of religious intolerance without stepping over into the area of freedom of religion or non-religion and expression. So there is much to be done, and there is a lot of challenging opportunities for each of us as we leave this prayer breakfast, this 58th prayer breakfast.&rdquo;</span></div>
